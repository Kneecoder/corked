# Corked Runner Report — spark 03

Generated: 2026-11-07T11:20:02.226Z
Worker: https://orked-m1-proxy.kneebonewebdesign.workers.dev

## Test under this spark
Solution-language spark, class 1 direction door. Expect: first pass bottleable_cloudy (person visible, no problem), followup fires, re-bottle lands cellar_ready or cloudy-with-problem. M2 question uses the direction door: no "think of the last time" / "describe the moment" phrasing. The told-not-watched moment grades settled.

## Raw Spark
```
A better scheduling app for gym owners.
```

Maturity class: 1
Grape: Marco — owns the boxing gym where I train
expect_halt: false

Line sent to the worker (the spark as typed): "A better scheduling app for gym owners."

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): "A better scheduling app for gym owners."

## Element Tracker (final state, floor-enforced like corked_v6.html's rankUp — see "raw grades" for what each mechanism actually offered before the floor was applied)
- **Grape**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M1)
  raw grades: M1=settled
- **Tell**: inert — history: inert
- **Vintage**: inert — history: inert
- **Gap**: inert — history: inert
- **Echo**: inert — history: inert
- **Limit**: inert — history: inert

## Halt
⛔ M2 Phase A outcome: insufficient, no problem on record. Stopped at M2.

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- none
