# Corked Runner Report — spark 02

Generated: 2026-10-21T16:34:54.443Z
Worker: http://127.0.0.1:8788

## Test under this spark
gap_in_play true. Expect: Phase A sets gap_in_play true (tool named plus failure). M2 grades three bars; gap settles from the answer, not the spark text. Floor rule holds.

## Raw Spark
```
A tool for freelance designers because Moneybird's payment reminders only go out after an invoice is already two weeks overdue.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Sanne — my old classmate, freelance designer
expect_halt: false

Line sent to the worker (the spark as typed): (none — halted before M0 returned one)

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): (none)

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- none
