# Corked Runner Report — spark 12

Generated: 2026-10-21T16:40:23.625Z
Worker: http://127.0.0.1:8789

## Test under this spark
Class 2 self battery. Expect: M1 self-mode settled (concrete instance present). M3 echo turbid — the Echo can never be the speaker; observation pivots away from self. M4 settled (separate person satisfies self mode). M5 settled — self's own current tool is the one place self counts as Gap material, and the founder's own build exclusion does not fire on a budgeting app he did not build. M6 response omits the echo field entirely; record how the words bar grades a self-quote (mild corner, real exchange with oneself). M7 settled.

## Raw Spark
```
An app to stop myself doomchecking my bank balance at the end of every month.
```

Maturity class: 2
Grape: Jamie — Last month I checked my balance eleven times on the 28th while one client invoice sat unpaid.
expect_halt: false

Line sent to the worker (the spark as typed): "An app to stop myself doomchecking my bank balance at the end of every month."

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): "A way for me to stop doomchecking my bank balance at the end of every month."

## Element Tracker (final state, floor-enforced like corked_v6.html's rankUp — see "raw grades" for what each mechanism actually offered before the floor was applied)
- **Grape**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M1)
  raw grades: M1=settled
- **Tell**: inert — history: inert
- **Vintage**: inert — history: inert
- **Gap**: inert — history: inert
- **Echo**: inert — history: inert
- **Limit**: inert — history: inert

## Halt
⛔ M2 Phase A request failed.

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- none
