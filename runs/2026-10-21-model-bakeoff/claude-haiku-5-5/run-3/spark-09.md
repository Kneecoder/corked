# Corked Runner Report — spark 09

## Test under this spark
Cap-edge verbose problem. Expect: either M0 compresses suspected_problem under the 300-char field cap and the chain runs, or a downstream call 400s on "spark_parse.suspected_problem exceeds max length". The second outcome means legitimate verbose input kills the chain — a sturdiness finding to fix, not user error.

## Raw Spark
```
A tool for physiotherapists in small practices because every time an insurer rejects a claim over a mismatched treatment code the physio has to dig the original referral letter out of one system, cross-check the code list in a second system, rewrite the claim line by line in the insurer portal, and then remember to follow up two weeks later to see if it went through this time, and nobody in a two-person practice has a spare afternoon for that every single week.
```

Line sent to the worker (the spark as typed): "A tool for physiotherapists in small practices because every time an insurer rejects a claim over a mismatched treatment code the physio has to dig the original referral letter out of one system, cross-check the code list in a second system, rewrite the claim line by line in the insurer portal, and then remember to follow up two weeks later to see if it went through this time, and nobody in a two-person practice has a spare afternoon for that every single week."

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): "A tool for physiotherapists in small practices to handle insurer claim rejections over mismatched treatment codes when the referral letter, code list and portal rewrite each take a separate step."

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M6 offered clearing for Tell, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
