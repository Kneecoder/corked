# Corked Runner Report — spark 16

Worker: http://127.0.0.1:8790

## Test under this spark
M5 one leg — with secondary M7 probe. Expect: M5 gap clearing — named solution, no failure point. M7 limit clearing — a who without a why, and a loose category rather than a bounded group. (m2, m3, m4, m6 not specified by the brief — left on generic settled-quality placeholders.)

## Raw Spark
```
An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Noor — my friend, runs a one-woman landscaping business
expect_halt: false

Line sent to the worker (the spark as typed): "An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem."

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): "A way for one-man trade businesses to chase unpaid invoices before the money becomes a problem."

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M6 offered clearing for Tell, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
