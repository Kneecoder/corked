# Corked Runner Report — spark 08

## Test under this spark
Sanitizer mutation probe — proven-bug regression. Record user_line_candidate verbatim. cleanVisibleText strips "not just", which can turn "do not just pay late" into "do pay late" — a meaning inversion. If the line mutates, the known sanitizer bug has regressed into user-facing text. If M0 rephrases to avoid the construction while keeping both facts (late AND partial), that is a pass.

## Raw Spark
```
A tool for landlords because tenants do not just pay late, they pay in random partial chunks nobody can reconcile.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Bram — my uncle, owns four rental flats
expect_halt: false

Line sent to the worker (the spark as typed): "A tool for landlords because tenants do not just pay late, they pay in random partial chunks nobody can reconcile."

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): "A tool for landlords to reconcile tenant payments that arrive late and in random partial amounts."

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M6 offered clearing for Tell, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
