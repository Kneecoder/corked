# Corked Runner Report — spark 15

## Test under this spark
M2 tell clearing, vintage unanchored — the most common real answer shape. Expect: tell clearing (emotion in place of behaviour), vintage clearing ("whenever" is recurring, unanchored), overall clearing. A swirl should plausibly fire; log its kind and question, do not answer it. (m3-m7 not specified by the brief — left on generic settled-quality placeholders since they are not under test here.)

## Raw Spark
```
An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Noor — my friend, runs a one-woman landscaping business
expect_halt: false

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): "A way for one-man trade businesses to chase unpaid invoices before the money becomes a problem."

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- ⚠ VOICE: contrast-formula ("not X but Y" / "not just X") found at M5.observation.surface_text: "The answer names an existing solution: a plain spreadsheet template Noor uses to track unpaid invoices. The answer states a failure point, that the template does not catch the problem until it is already too late, but does not specify what late means or how the spreadsheet falls short in mechanism."

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
