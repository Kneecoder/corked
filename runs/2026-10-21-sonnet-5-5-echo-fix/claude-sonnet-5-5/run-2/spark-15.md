# Corked Runner Report — spark 15

## Test under this spark
M2 tell clearing, vintage unanchored — the most common real answer shape. Expect: tell clearing (emotion in place of behaviour), vintage clearing ("whenever" is recurring, unanchored), overall clearing. A swirl should plausibly fire; log its kind and question, do not answer it. (m3-m7 not specified by the brief — left on generic settled-quality placeholders since they are not under test here.)

## Raw Spark
```
An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Noor — my friend, runs a one-woman landscaping business
expect_halt: false

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M6 offered turbid for Tell, held at floor clearing (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
