# Corked Runner Report — spark 10

Generated: 2026-11-07T14:05:08.686Z
Worker: https://abdeab65-orked-m1-proxy.kneebonewebdesign.workers.dev

## Test under this spark
M3 category rule, then M4 rank-up. Expect: M3 echo clearing, never settled — the named workaround does not rescue the category; observation names a population, not a person. M4 echo settled, so element history shows clearing -> settled with no regression. M4 contrast fields are strings: is_different_kind "true", same_or_different "different" (the boolean-wipe bug check).

## Raw Spark
```
An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Tomas — my neighbour, carpenter with a one-man business
expect_halt: false

Line sent to the worker (the spark as typed): "An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem."

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): "An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem."

## Element Tracker (final state, floor-enforced like corked_v6.html's rankUp — see "raw grades" for what each mechanism actually offered before the floor was applied)
- **Grape**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M1)
  raw grades: M1=settled
- **Tell**: clearing — history: inert → clearing (last raised by M6)
  raw grades: M2=clearing, M6=clearing
- **Vintage**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M2)
  raw grades: M2=settled
- **Gap**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M5)
  raw grades: M5=settled
- **Echo**: clearing — history: inert → clearing (last raised by M6)
  raw grades: M3=clearing, M4=clearing, M6=turbid
- **Limit**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M7)
  raw grades: M7=settled

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor clearing (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
