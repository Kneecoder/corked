## Test under this spark
Control — everything settles. Expect: cellar_ready, problem_forced_verbatim true, needs_confirmation false, gap_in_play false (no gap bar in M2 response). All six elements settled by M7. M4 contrast: is_different_kind "true", same_or_different "different". Zero substitution flags, zero anomalies.

## Raw Spark
```
An app for wedding photographers who lose their deposit when couples cancel two days before the shoot.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Lena — my cousin, she shoots weddings
expect_halt: false

Line sent to the worker (the spark as typed): "An app for wedding photographers who lose their deposit when couples cancel two days before the shoot."

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): "A way for wedding photographers to handle losing their deposit when couples cancel two days before the shoot."

## Element Tracker (final state, floor-enforced like corked_v6.html's rankUp — see "raw grades" for what each mechanism actually offered before the floor was applied)

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M6 offered clearing for Tell, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
