## Test under this spark
A group (v48 call 9). Expect: grape turbid, person_kind category_only: not one person.

## Raw Spark
```
An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: (none) — freelancers I know
expect_halt: true

Line sent to the worker (the spark as typed): "An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem."

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): "An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem."

## Element Tracker (final state, floor-enforced like corked_v6.html's rankUp — see "raw grades" for what each mechanism actually offered before the floor was applied)
- **Grape**: turbid — history: inert → turbid (last raised by M1)
  raw grades: M1=turbid
- **Tell**: inert — history: inert
- **Vintage**: inert — history: inert
- **Gap**: inert — history: inert
- **Echo**: inert — history: inert
- **Limit**: inert — history: inert

## Halt
⛔ Stops after M1: this case checks the person grade only.

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- none
