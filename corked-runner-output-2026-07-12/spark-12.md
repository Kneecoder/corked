## Test under this spark
Class 2 self battery. Expect: M1 self-mode settled (concrete instance present). M3 echo turbid — the Echo can never be the speaker; observation pivots away from self. M4 settled (separate person satisfies self mode). M5 settled — self's own current tool is the one place self counts as Gap material, and the founder's own build exclusion does not fire on a budgeting app he did not build. M6 response omits the echo field entirely; record how the words bar grades a self-quote (mild corner, real exchange with oneself). M7 settled.

## Raw Spark
```
An app to stop myself doomchecking my bank balance at the end of every month.
```

Maturity class: 2
Grape: Jamie — Last month I checked my balance eleven times on the 28th while one client invoice sat unpaid.
expect_halt: false

User Line candidate (verbatim from M0): "A way for me to stop doomchecking my bank balance at the end of every month."

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M3 offered turbid for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
