# Corked Runner Report — spark 02

Generated: 2026-07-12T15:41:02.221Z
Worker: https://orked-m1-proxy.kneebonewebdesign.workers.dev

## Test under this spark
gap_in_play true. Expect: Phase A sets gap_in_play true (tool named plus failure). M2 grades three bars; gap settles from the answer, not the spark text. Floor rule holds.

## Raw Spark
```
A tool for freelance designers because Moneybird's payment reminders only go out after an invoice is already two weeks overdue.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Sanne — my old classmate, freelance designer
expect_halt: false

User Line candidate (verbatim from M0): "A tool for freelance designers who use Moneybird, where payment reminders only go out after an invoice is already two weeks overdue."

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M3 offered clearing for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M4 offered clearing for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M4 offered turbid for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
