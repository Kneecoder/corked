# Corked Runner Report — spark 17

## Test under this spark
M5 own-build substitution. Expect: gap turbid regardless of how precisely the shortcomings are described — the founder's own build is never a valid existing fix. substitution_detected true. (m2, m3, m4, m6, m7 not specified by the brief — left on generic settled-quality placeholders.)

## Raw Spark
```
An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Noor — my friend, runs a one-woman landscaping business
expect_halt: false

User Line candidate (verbatim from M0): "An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem."

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M3 offered clearing for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M4 offered clearing for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M4 offered turbid for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
