# Corked Runner Report — spark 18

## Test under this spark
M6 reconstructed cap — hard rule. Expect: words clearing, never settled, no matter how vivid the quote. Echo bar forced turbid (words_source is not real). Observation notes the reconstruction without coaching toward what a real exchange would earn. (m2-m5, m7 not specified by the brief — left on generic settled-quality placeholders.)

## Raw Spark
```
An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Noor — my friend, runs a one-woman landscaping business
words_source override: reconstructed
expect_halt: false

User Line candidate (verbatim from M0): "An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem."

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- ⚠ VOICE: contrast-formula ("not X but Y" / "not just X") found at M5.observation.surface_text: "The answer names an existing solution: a plain spreadsheet template. The failure point given is that it does not catch the problem until too late, which describes a timing deficiency but does not name a precise mechanism, such as what the spreadsheet fails to do that would constitute catching it in time."

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M3 offered clearing for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M4 offered clearing for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M4 offered turbid for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
