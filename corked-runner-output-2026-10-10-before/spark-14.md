## Test under this spark
M4 prior-echo exclusion. Expect: M3 settled. M4 echo clearing — same person rephrased is not a second person; contrast fields "unclear". Confirm prior_echo_context was populated from the M3 answer in the M4 request.

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M4 offered clearing for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M4 offered turbid for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered clearing for Tell, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
