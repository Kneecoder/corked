# Corked Runner Report — spark 11

## Test under this spark
M3 grape exclusion — plus one doctrine corner to record. Expect: echo turbid despite the concrete behaviour and moment — every person in the answer is the grape. Corner to record: does Vintage rank up opportunistically off this grape-only moment while echo goes turbid? Doctrine says Vintage grades when the answer carries a moment; it does not say whose. Log the result either way; this is a doctrine call waiting to be made, not a bug.

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M3 offered clearing for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M4 offered clearing for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor clearing (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
