## Test under this spark
Control — everything settles. Expect: cellar_ready, problem_forced_verbatim true, needs_confirmation false, gap_in_play false (no gap bar in M2 response). All six elements settled by M7. M4 contrast: is_different_kind "true", same_or_different "different". Zero substitution flags, zero anomalies.

## Raw Spark
```
An app for wedding photographers who lose their deposit when couples cancel two days before the shoot.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Lena — my cousin, she shoots weddings
expect_halt: false

User Line candidate (verbatim from M0): "A way for wedding photographers to avoid losing their deposit when a couple cancels two days before the shoot."

## Element Tracker (final state, floor-enforced like corked_v6.html's rankUp — see "raw grades" for what each mechanism actually offered before the floor was applied)
- **Grape**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M1)
  raw grades: M1=settled
- **Tell**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M6)
  raw grades: M2=settled, M6=clearing
- **Vintage**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M4)
  raw grades: M2=settled, M3=settled, M4=turbid
- **Gap**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M5)
  raw grades: M5=settled
- **Echo**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M6)
  raw grades: M3=settled, M4=settled, M6=turbid
- **Limit**: settled — history: inert → settled (last raised by M7)

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- none detected

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M4 offered turbid for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered clearing for Tell, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
