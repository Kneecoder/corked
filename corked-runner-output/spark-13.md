# Corked Runner Report — spark 13

## Test under this spark
Substitution rule, M2 — with secondary M6 probe. Expect: M2 substitution_detected true, tell turbid (no grape behaviour referenced at all), overall turbid. Observation names what was described and what was asked for, nothing more — no interpretation, no named avoidance. Secondary: M6 words turbid — the builder's framing presented as the grape's meaning is not language from the grape.

## Raw Spark
```
An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Daan — my former colleague, wedding DJ
expect_halt: false

User Line candidate (verbatim from M0): "An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem."

## Element Tracker (final state, floor-enforced like corked_v6.html's rankUp — see "raw grades" for what each mechanism actually offered before the floor was applied)
