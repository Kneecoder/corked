# Corked Runner Report — spark 13

Generated: 2026-10-10T13:03:16.622Z
Worker: https://orked-m1-proxy.kneebonewebdesign.workers.dev

## Test under this spark
Substitution rule, M2 — with secondary M6 probe. Expect: M2 substitution_detected true, tell turbid (no grape behaviour referenced at all), overall turbid. Observation names what was described and what was asked for, nothing more — no interpretation, no named avoidance. Secondary: M6 words turbid — the builder's framing presented as the grape's meaning is not language from the grape.

## Raw Spark
```
An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Daan — my former colleague, wedding DJ
expect_halt: false

Line sent to the worker (the spark as typed): "An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem."

M0's line (verbatim, not shown in the app): "An app for one-man trade businesses who forget to chase unpaid invoices until the money is a problem."
