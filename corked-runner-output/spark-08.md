# Corked Runner Report — spark 08

## Test under this spark
Sanitizer mutation probe — proven-bug regression. Record user_line_candidate verbatim. cleanVisibleText strips "not just", which can turn "do not just pay late" into "do pay late" — a meaning inversion. If the line mutates, the known sanitizer bug has regressed into user-facing text. If M0 rephrases to avoid the construction while keeping both facts (late AND partial), that is a pass.

## Raw Spark
```
A tool for landlords because tenants do not just pay late, they pay in random partial chunks nobody can reconcile.
```

Maturity class: 0
Grape: Bram — my uncle, owns four rental flats
expect_halt: false

User Line candidate (verbatim from M0): "A tool for landlords when tenants pay in random partial chunks nobody can reconcile."

## Anomalies (automated mechanical checks — substitution_detected typing, gap-bar/echo-bar consistency, overall-state-equals-primary-bar, voice/em-dash/contrast-formula scan, anchor fabrication)
- ⚠ VOICE: contrast-formula ("not X but Y" / "not just X") found at M0.raw_spark: "A tool for landlords because tenants do not just pay late, they pay in random partial chunks nobody can reconcile."

## Floor notes (informational — a later mechanism offered a lower grade for an opportunistic bar; the floor correctly held, no action needed)
- M4 offered turbid for Vintage, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered clearing for Tell, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
- M6 offered turbid for Echo, held at floor settled (opportunistic grading correctly did not lower it).
